Additional text processing such as the exclusion of stop_words and lemmatization will be done after the raw text is pre-processed."

       "\"the u. s. postal service announced wednesday a plan to boost online commerce by enhancing the security and reliability of electronic mail traveling on the internet. under the plan businesses and consumers can verify that email has not been tampered with and use services now available for ordinary mail like sending a certified letter.the leap from trading messages to buying and selling goods has been blocked by the fear of security threats robert reisner vice president of stategic planning said. to expand from local area networks and bilateral secure communications to wide use of electronic commerce will require a new generation of security services reisner said. cylink corp is developing a system for the post office to use to verify the identity of email senders. the system will enable people to register a digital signature with the post office that can be compared against electronic mail they send. if any tampering is discovered the postal service would investigate just like it investigates tampering with regular mail reisner said. the post office is also using the internet to enhance nonelectronic mail delivery. in conjunction with sun microsystems the postal service has also developed a new online system for bulk mailers that relies on sun's java computer language reisner said. instead of manually calculating postage rates for bulk mailings possibly using outdated forms a bulk mailer will be able to add up the charges using a software application written with java and posted on the internet. eventually the post office plans to offer hybrid services involving both kinds of mail reisner said. electronic mail could be converted to paper and delivered within one business day for example. or someone who moves could register a change of address with the post office over the internet. critics of the post office's internet plans have said the service is usurping functions that could be better performed by the private sector. but reisner rejected those arguments maintaining that the post office has often facilitated the spread of new technologies such as railroads and aircraft. remember the pilots who returned from world war i and then risked their lives in an even more dangerous duty resiner said refering to early airmail delivery efforts.to keep these daring pilots alive the postal service had to create parts of what we know as the weather service today. navigation aids had to be developed. we are watching many of these same dynamics today. earlier experience tells us that this is a public and private job.2028988312\""

    "Our text is ready to be processed. How are we going to do that? __Vectorization.__ This process turns words into vectors. These vectors are the values that we use for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sklearn offers two popular vectorizing models (although there are many others), _Bag of Words_ (\"CountVectorizer\") and _Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency_ (\"TfidfVectorizer\"). Bag of words vectors represent raw counts of each vectorized word found in a given article, and tfidf vectors represent inverse ratios of the word's frequency in a given article.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Okay cool...so what are we adding to the vectorizers?\n",
    "\n",
    "These two sklearn models vectorize _individual words_ only. There are more sophisticated models that can vectorize whole sentences at once. If you want to use count or tfidf for sentences, we can __tokenize__ the articles into sentences, which are broken into their own individual dataframe index values, and then use one of the two vectorizers to analyze the individual words in those sentences. We will not do that here: the articles are not uniform size, and so tokenizing the articles into words would imbalance the data. It also will use an unnecessaryamount of resources to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that ___sklearn models do the tokenization___! If you choose to tokenize yourself via the spaCy module, you will have to join back the text and then _re-tokenize_ it through the vectorizer.  We may need to do this instead of easily pushing in the raw (but cleaned) text documents; it appears that sklearn vectorizers do not have any native lemmatization hyperparameters (believe me, I looked..._a lot..._), and I believe lemmatization is crucial for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here we will do three things: run raw text documentation through (1) countvectorizer and (2) tfidfvectorizer. Separately, we will (3) lemmatize and tokenize the text with the spaCy module, and once that is done, rejoin the lemmatized tokens into raw text which we will push through tfidfvectorizer. We will analyze the data via __Latent Semantic Analysis__, where we will choose the best dataset to work with (and in turn, determine which way to df_test dataset)."
